Requirements:
-------------

Must:
  efl
  libc libm libX11 libXext
  xcb xcb-shape xcb-keysyms

NOTE: Users of DR16 will need to rename the $prefix/bin/enlightenment
file prior to installing this release or it will be overwritten.

NOTES:

* if you do not want security issues make sure sysactions.conf is in
/etc/enlightenment (not PREFIX/etc/enlightenment) as this is the first place
it looks at. This file is intended to be customized by packagers and
system integrators to match your policies and scripts/tools.
